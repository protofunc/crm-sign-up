Group 4 Project Breakdown

Assignment Breakdown:
- As a team we decided that Dan would host the repo, add iniital set of files (.html, .css), and merge PRs as they came in. 
- We broke down work into 3 separate portions (reference "crm design - breakout.png"). Dan took section 1, Devein took section 2, Moe took Section 3.
- Comments in the .html and .css files annote who worked on what. Additionally, Devin added bootstrap and worked on integrating all three sections together into a single container.
